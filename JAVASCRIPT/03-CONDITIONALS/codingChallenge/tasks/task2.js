/* To complete this challenge, we'll initialize a variable 
that stores an appropiate boolean value. We will then use that variable
in the condition of the if statement so that the code block runs.
    1. Create a const variable named go and store the value true in it.
    2. Use the go variable that you created in the condition for the if statement 
    so that the code block runs when go === true */

    const go = true;
    if (go === true) {
        console.log("Program Running!")
