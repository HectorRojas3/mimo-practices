/* In a similar fashion to the last challenge, 
we'll initialize a const variable named go
with the value false. We will also write an if-else statment to determine
whether the program runs 
    1. First create a const variable named go, and assign the boolean value false
    2. Next, write an if-else statement whose condition is the variable go
    3. if the if code block executes print "Program Running!" in the console.
    Otherwise, print "Program Failed!" */
